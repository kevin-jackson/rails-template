# Vendor Extensions

Rails applications have a `vendor/` folder containing all the CSS files from external libraries and frameworks â€“ Normalize, jQueryPluginXYZ and so on.
Putting those aside in the `vendor/` folder makes it clear they are not our code, our responsibility.

If you have to override a section of any vendor, put the overrides in `vendor-extensions/`, in which you may have files named exactly after the vendors they overwrite.
For instance, `vendor-extensions/_pikaday.sass` is a file containing all CSS rules intended to re-declare some of Pikadayâ€™s default CSS. This is to avoid editing the vendor files themselves, which is generally not a good idea.
